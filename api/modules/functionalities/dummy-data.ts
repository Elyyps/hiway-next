    "Meet the power of a modular design. As with any software or platform, quite often, functionality is not 100% fitted to every company. We are changing this by offering a modular build software suite. Select what features you would like to use, deselect what you don’t need, and if something is missing, simply reach out, and we’ll look for a way to make this module available as soon as possible. Below you'll find a list of the main functionalities currently offered by the HR Platform. At the bottom of this page, we also listed the main modules we are working on as of right now! As always, the Hiway team can help you with any module related question or showcase modules that are still in development. Reach out, and we'll arrange a video call!",
